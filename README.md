JAutoDiff : An Automatic Differentiation Library (Pure Java)
=============================================================

[Automatic differentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation/) 
is a tequnique to compute the derivatives of a function algebraically.  
There are many implementation in C/C++ (ex. 
[FADBAD++](http://www.fadbad.com/fadbad.html), 
[ADOL-C](http://projects.coin-or.org/ADOL-C), etc.), while are few in Java.

*JAutoDiff* is an automatic differentiation library coded in 100%  pure Java.  
This library provides a framework to compute derivatives of functions 
on arbitrary types of [field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_\(mathematics\)) 
using [generics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java).

*Attention : At present, only adapters for double precision real numbers has been implemented,
  while adapters for [ia_math](http://interval.sourceforge.net/interval/java/ia_math/README.html), 
  one of the implementations of [interval arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic), 
  will be available soon.*
